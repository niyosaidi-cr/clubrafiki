      'Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) is a major concern across Rwandan communities, including rural areas where poverty and lack of structured activities leave many youth — especially girls — vulnerable to early unplanned pregnancy and other harmful circumstances.',
      'Club Rafiki\'s health services conduct regular adolescent education on SRHR on a weekly basis at our youth center in Nyamirambo and in the rural areas of Kanyinya and Mageragere. Peer educators use an individual approach — interacting one-on-one with youth of matching gender — so that participants feel comfortable, safe, and free to ask questions without embarrassment.',
      'Through strong collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Rwanda Biomedical Center, City of Kigali, and Nyarugenge District, Club Rafiki also runs large-scale awareness campaigns tackling drug abuse, HIV/AIDS, and unwanted pregnancy. In August 2023, a national anti-drugs campaign hosted at our center brought together approximately 2,000 students from high schools across Kigali.',
      'Club Rafiki also organizes Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) mobile units, bringing HIV testing directly to communities in Nyamirambo, Rugarama, and Nyabugogo cells — making life-saving services accessible to those who might not otherwise seek them.',
